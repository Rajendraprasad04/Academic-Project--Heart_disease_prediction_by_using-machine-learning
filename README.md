Project Name: Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

"My project is about predicting the chances of someone having heart disease using machine learning, which is a type of artificial intelligence. The goal is to help doctors make quicker and more accurate decisions about a patient's health.

To do this, I used a dataset that includes important health information like age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, blood sugar, and other factors that can affect heart health. I cleaned up the data to remove any errors, chose the most important health indicators, and then used different machine learning algorithms to train models that could predict whether a person might have heart disease.

I tested several models, like Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression, to see which one predicted the best. After evaluating them, I found that Logistic Regression gave the most accurate results, with an accuracy of 90 percentage.

The result is a model that can help healthcare professionals quickly identify patients at risk of heart disease, potentially leading to early intervention and better health outcomes."
